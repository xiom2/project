<h1>I Like You When You Are Quiet</h1>
<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Neruda">Pablo Neruda</a></h3>

</p>I <strong>like you</strong> when you are quiet because it is as though you are <em>absent</em>, <br>
and you hear me from far away, and my voice does not touch you.<br>
It looks as though your eyes had flown away <br>
and it looks as if a kiss had sealed your mouth.</p> <br><br>

<p>Like all things are full of my soul <br>
You emerge from the things, full of my soul.<br>
Dream butterfly, you look like <strong>my soul</strong>, <br>
    and you look like a <em>melancoly</em> word.</p> <br><br>

<p>I <strong>like you when </strong>you are quiet and it is as though you are distant. <br>
It is as though you are complaining, butterfly in lullaby.<br>
And you hear me from far away, and my voice<em> does not reach you</em>: <br>
let me fall quiet with your own silence.</p> <br><br>

<p>Let me also speak to you with your silence <br>
Clear like a lamp, simple like a ring. <br>
You are like the night, quiet and <strong>constellated</strong>. <br>
    Your silence is of a star, so far away and solitary.</p> <br><br>

<p>I like you when you are <strong>quiet</strong> because it is as though you are absent.<br>
Distant and painful as if you had <strong>died</strong>. <br>
A word then, a smile is enough. <br>
    And I am happy, happy that it is not true.</p> <br><br><be></be>
